This repository includes the `nba_data_lake.py` script, which automates the process of building a data lake for NBA analytics using AWS tools. The script leverages Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Athena to establish the necessary infrastructure for storing and querying NBA-related data.
In this project, we will use three AWS services: S3, Glue, and Athena. Amazon S3 will serve as the storage layer for our sports data analytics data lake, where it will hold both raw and processed data in various formats such as JSON, CSV, and Parquet. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that will catalog the data stored in S3 and enable schema definitions, making the data ready for querying with tools like Athena. Glue's crawler will scan the S3 bucket, retrieve the unprocessed data, and make it available for querying. Amazon Athena, an interactive query service, will allow users to run SQL queries directly on the data stored in S3 without needing to move it. Athena is a serverless and pay-as-you-go service, enabling seamless analytics and exploration of the NBA data stored in S3. In summary, S3 will store the NBA data, Glue will create a metadata layer with schemas and tables for querying, and Athena will execute SQL queries on the Glue catalog data directly in S3, enabling efficient analytics.
